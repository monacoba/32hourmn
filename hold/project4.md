I have a busy life and a lot of commitments around the house and with my family, honestly weekends usually end with me more exhausted than I was at the end of work week just from trying to catch up with everything with the free time. A 32 hour work week would allow me to be more charged and excited for work for the time it is happening. More engaged and ready to face challenges.
