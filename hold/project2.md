Gosh where do I even begin?! I’d spend more time with my son (he’s 1) and my husband and our dogs and cat. I’d see my extended family and some of my dearest friends more—they’re mostly in Boston/New England, where I grew up. I’d start dancing again. I danced professionally for a while after college, was at a crossroads about whether to choose dance or public health as a career (terrible choice, the dream is to combine the two! I’m just stuck for obvious reasons lol), chose public health and the dancing has suffered (sad). I’m also a recovering perfectionist/overachiever that just started putting up boundaries as a new mom which feels so, so good. But I’m still totally and completely exhausted and extra time for self-care would be __heavenly__.
