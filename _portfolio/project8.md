I’ve built my life around public service, but never filled in the rest of the picture of who I am. I am neurodivergent, and spending my days fitting into the mold required to do my job leaves me exhausted, even though I’m excited when I get to do good work that helps people. Add in the mental load that comes with running a household, and there’s no energy left to explore hobbies or be as involved in my community as I’d like to be. When it’s 8 pm and I’m finally sitting down (to watch tv) after getting ready for work, commuting, working, commuting, grocery shopping, cooking dinner, doing the dishes, cleaning up, and taking care of the dog, I feel like I’m a robot, and I want the time and energy to experience my humanity on my own terms- whether that’s trying new things, moving my body, creating something or connecting with friends and family.
