I have elderly parents, one of which might be coming to live with me soon and having more time to spend with them, my spouse, and to get all the things done that are required for modern living would be truly amazing. I currently work a flex schedule and having that one friday to get things done _and_ have two more weekend days is worth the extra hours but also...I shouldn't have to because we deserve to have time to create, play, and live.
