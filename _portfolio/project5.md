In my previous job I worked a lot of hours trying to make the world a better place, but didn't have the emotional or mental capacity to be present with my own son, Rowan. He deserves a dad who has time and energy to parent well. I like to think of the three-day weekend as 1 day for rest, 1 day for play, 1 day for laundry and groceries.
