I have spent much of my career trying to make the world a better place. Those are often demanding, all-consuming jobs. In a recent role, I worked long hours, getting phone calls, texts, and emails any time of the day and week. I regularly responded to texts while sitting at the dinner table with my family. As my son, Rowan, turned six, I knew I didn’t want to spend the rest of his childhood constantly preoccupied with work. He deserves better. And so do I. A lot of our parents worked hard to give their kids a better life and a better world. Now, as a dad, I’ve learned that part of that better world for Rowan, is parents with more time and energy to be the kind of parents he deserves.
