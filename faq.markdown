**There is not enough time for everything I have to do. Wouldn’t this make life more stressful?**

When San Juan County employees transitioned to a 32-hour workweek, [78% of workers](https://engage.sanjuancountywa.gov/20872/widgets/81869/documents/54512) reported a positive increase in mental health. 

One of the important things a 32-hour workweek does is require workplaces to address existing issues. That could look like shortening unnecessarily long meetings or cutting out unnecessary meetings completely. [Move Minnesota](https://www.movemn.org), which adopted the 32-hour workweek, now has a policy that every meeting must have an owner, an agenda, and clear deliverables. Or it could require agencies to stop piling more work onto other workers when there is a vacant position, and actually drive the hiring process forward to fill those needed roles.

Moving to a 32-hour workweek would also be a huge benefit to talent recruitment and retention, increasing both the pool of applicants and the length of service of the workers themselves. With a 32-hour workweek, the cost of workers leaving decreases because they leave less often. In 61 companies that piloted the 4-Day Workweek in the UK, staff turnover reduced 57%. 

[Meet and Confer](https://mape.org/committees/meet-and-confer-committees) is an essential place for the union to work out the implementation of a 32-hour workweek and raise the issues that need to be addressed for the transition to be a success.

**Would this impact my healthcare benefits?**

No. A 32-hour workweek would be considered full-time employment and healthcare would not be impacted by this change.

**How would this work in x industry or agency?**

All around the country we see examples of the 32-hour workweek across industries - [a police department in CO](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/golden-police-department-4-day-work-week-productivity-up-better-community-connection/), [senior care workers in WI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbHzrdHSZGc), [Manufacturing in OH](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/11/1207991399/4-four-day-work-week-manufacturing-work-life-balance), and [county workers in WA](https://engage.sanjuancountywa.gov/20872/widgets/81869/documents/54512). It will take some figuring out, and it’s really important to make the process intentional, but there is a path for everyone to the 32-hour workweek.

**Won’t this feed into negative stereotypes about government employees?**

The 32-hour workweek is [popular with the public](https://www.dataforprogress.org/datasets/polling-on-32-hour-work-week)!

We believe all workers deserve more time ‘for what we will.’ We’re not alone in this demand. We’re joining a growing movement of workers across industries who are pushing for a 32-hour workweek. As a union we can lead the way toward a societal shift that benefits all workers, just as labor unions led the way to the 40 hour workweek a hundred years ago.

Additionally, studies have shown that employees, including those in the public sector, often become more productive and efficient with a shorter workweek. By focusing on delivering high-quality services in less time, government employees can demonstrate their dedication and effectiveness. Improved work-life balance can lead to higher job satisfaction and morale, which can translate into better service for the community. This change isn't only about working less, but about working smarter and showing that government employees are committed to excellence and innovation.

**How will this work for Field, On-Call or other kinds of workers in MAPE?**

The 32-hour workweek will look different for different sectors. While some people might be working a four-day week M-Th, others might have their 32-hours spread across the week to accommodate for being on-call or ensuring that a specific area is always staffed 24/7. The important aspect is that 32-hours is considered full-time and people would be compensated with overtime for any hours they work beyond the 32 hours.

**What are the cost-saving benefits of a 4DW?**

- Turnover is [estimated](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247391/fixable-problem-costs-businesses-trillion.aspx) to cost at least ½ of an employee’s salary. Reducing working hours with no loss in pay drastically lowers turnover rates, with [resignations down 22%](https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fe56f2c1-e4ed-ae6c-12a1-570c703651b9/Dr.%20Schor%20HELP%20Testimony%203-14-24.pdf). 
- In pilot programs, employers averaged a [30% increase in revenue](https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fe56f2c1-e4ed-ae6c-12a1-570c703651b9/Dr.%20Schor%20HELP%20Testimony%203-14-24.pdf). 
- Some organizations - if moving to a 4 day workweek - can save on 1 day of office infrastructure costs (cleaning, supplies, utilities)

**I’m worried that pushing for this will mean we don’t get wage increases.**

Let’s take a lesson from the Can Company workers in 1937 who won wages and time! Having multiple bold demands can strengthen us in contract negotiations. Last year United Auto Workers included a 32-hour workweek in their demands, and while they didn’t win it, they did win [historic pay raises](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/16/1212381342/gm-autoworkers-vote-yes-approve-uaw-contract-ford-stellantis#:~:text=But%20workers%20will%20get%20pay%20increases%20of%20at,money%20will%20see%20their%20pay%20more%20than%20double.). AFSCME in San Juan County won both a 32-hour workweek and wage increases.

**How would this impact vacation time?**

This is something the negotiating team will have to work out with input from members, but we want no change to vacation and sick time accrual.

>“Our members have had 416 hours per year of personal time restored to them with no impacts to health or retirement benefits. The change in hours has encouraged some members to stay in their positions and has helped to attract new staff. The burdens placed on many of our public servants have been reduced in ways that allow for a healthier balance between the demands of their jobs and those of their personal lives.”

**Why should employees get paid the same for working less?**

It’s helpful to think of work as output rather than time. Employers and employees exchange 100% pay for 100% output. Although employees will be working fewer hours, added rest and downtime translates to sharpened focus and higher quality output; the same goals - if not more - are achievable! Employers are benefiting from often higher productivity and higher returns from their employees, and employees should be compensated for that output.

**Will the 32-hour workweek only work for employees who are in salaried, office or teleworking positions?**

Some positions are the “low hanging fruit” for moving to a 32-hour workweek, including many state jobs. Knowledge work roles that were previously “office work” before hybrid and full-time teleworking became more of the norm are essentially already 32-hour workweeks. Once the unnecessary and overlong meetings, distractions and interruptions, outdated practices, wasteful processes, and poor use of technology are trimmed off the workweek, the 32-hour workweek is blooming.

For other positions and jobs, moving to the 32-hour workweek might require a deeper level of innovation and organizational redesign, and it’s an opportunity for creativity. We’re already seeing the 32-hour workweek work for industries that might seem challenging, like 24/7 emergency services - Police Departments in [Ohio](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2019/12/newburgh-heights-approves-32-hour-work-week-with-no-pay-cut-for-village-employees.html) and [Colorado](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/golden-police-department-4-day-work-week-productivity-up-better-community-connection/) have made the switch. As have healthcare and senior care employers in [New Jersey](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/26/nx-s1-5013956/4-four-day-week-work-life-balance-nurse-managers) and [Wisconsin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbHzrdHSZGc).
